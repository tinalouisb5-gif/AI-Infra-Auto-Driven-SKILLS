# vllm Qwen3.6 Model PR Optimization History

## Scope

- Rebuilt on: 2026-04-25
- Source baseline: `vllm-project/vllm` trace worktree commit `95995bbef8`
- PR collection rule: run `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` on model implementation, config, processor, parser, docs/tests, filter by model keywords in commit subjects, then read each PR's final diff through the GitHub Pull Request files API.
- Preservation rule: PRs explicitly cited by the previous history/skill are retained even if current implementation files no longer trace to them, and the card marks that source.

## Implementation File Coverage

| File | Git-traced PRs |
| --- | --- |
| - | No matching implementation file on current main |

## PR Coverage Summary

- Git-traced PRs: 0
- Extra PRs preserved from existing docs: 0
- Total PRs in this document: 0
- File trace command: `git log --name-only -- <model-files>`

## Per-PR Diff Audit Cards

### Public PR search conclusion

- Conclusion: No public PR was confirmed as part of the vllm Qwen3.6 model support or optimization line.
- Search method: `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` was run on the matched files, and explicit PR links in the previous history/skill were checked.
- Covered files: no matching implementation file on current main
- Acceptance rule: if implementation files or PRs appear later, add the same per-PR diff card format.

## Gap-Closure Notes

- Acceptance rule: every PR card must keep trace source, diff scope, implementation notes, code excerpts, reviewed files, and verification risk.
- If new model files fall outside the current filters, add the file filter first and rerun the same `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` trace.

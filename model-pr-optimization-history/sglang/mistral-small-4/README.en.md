# sglang Mistral Small 4 Model PR Optimization History

## Scope

- Rebuilt on: 2026-04-25
- Source baseline: `sgl-project/sglang` trace worktree commit `880599cd43`
- PR collection rule: run `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` on model implementation, config, processor, parser, docs/tests, filter by model keywords in commit subjects, then read each PR's final diff through the GitHub Pull Request files API.
- Preservation rule: PRs explicitly cited by the previous history/skill are retained even if current implementation files no longer trace to them, and the card marks that source.

## Gap-Closure Notes

- Acceptance rule: every PR card must keep trace source, diff scope, implementation notes, code excerpts, reviewed files, and verification risk.
- If new model files fall outside the current filters, add the file filter first and rerun the same `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` trace.

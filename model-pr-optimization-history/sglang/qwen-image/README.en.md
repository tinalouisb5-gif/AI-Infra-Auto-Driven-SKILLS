## PR Cards

### #18530 - AMD fused norm and RoPE

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/18530
- State: open, `2` files, `+95/-35`
- Motivation: Qwen-Image cross-attention on AMD ROCm runs Q/K RMSNorm and RoPE separately. The PR fuses them with AITER and reports Qwen-Image-Edit latency improving from `84.48s` to `79.72s`.
- Key implementation: add `SGLANG_ENABLE_FUSED_ROPE_RMS_2WAY`; under AITER/HIP/RMSNorm/image-RoPE conditions call `aiter.fused_rope_rms_2way` to produce joint query/key tensors.
- Code:

```python
use_fused_rope_rms = (
    _use_aiter
    and envs.SGLANG_ENABLE_FUSED_ROPE_RMS_2WAY.get()
    and image_rotary_emb is not None
)
```

```python
aiter.fused_rope_rms_2way(
    txt_query.contiguous(),
    txt_key.contiguous(),
    img_query.contiguous(),
    img_key.contiguous(),
    ...
    joint_query,
    joint_key,
)
```

- Validation: AMD/AITER image quality and denoise latency are required.

### #19066 - Qwen2.5-VL ViT/text encoder optimization

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19066
- State: open, `7` files, `+874/-21`
- Motivation: Qwen-Image-adjacent Qwen2.5-VL encoding was slow and less compile-friendly; AMD SDPA with non-contiguous q/k/v slices could accumulate numerical error.
- Key implementation: add custom `Qwen2_5_VisionTransformer`, backend selection, SDPA `.contiguous()` fix, RoPE/window cache, fused ViT `gate_up_proj`, SGLang RMSNorm, and torch.compile mode plumbing.
- Code:

```python
def get_vit_attn_backend(attn_implementation: str | None = None):
    if attn_implementation == "sdpa":
        return AttentionBackendEnum.TORCH_SDPA
    try:
        import flash_attn
        return AttentionBackendEnum.FA
    except ImportError:
        return AttentionBackendEnum.TORCH_SDPA
```

```python
output_i = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(
    query[:, :, start_idx:end_idx, :].contiguous(),
    key[:, :, start_idx:end_idx, :].contiguous(),
    value[:, :, start_idx:end_idx, :].contiguous(),
)
```

- Validation: run custom ViT vs HF consistency tests and Qwen-Image/Edit e2e generation.

### #19516 - Initial CUDA graph support

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19516
- State: open, `3` files, `+315/-36`
- Motivation: Qwen-Image profiles showed about `30%` CPU overhead. Shapes depend on resolution and prompt length, so the first design captures smaller block subfunctions and pads text length.
- Key implementation: split image/text pre/post attention, capture them with `torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables`, pad text to next power of two, and add `--enable-cuda-graph`.
- Code:

```python
def pad_tensor_into_power_of_2(tensor: torch.Tensor, dim: int) -> torch.Tensor:
    padded_length = next_power_of_2(tensor.shape[dim])
    ...
    return torch.cat([tensor, padding], dim=dim)
```

```python
torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables(
    self._txt_pre_attention_forward,
    (padded_encoder_hidden_states, temb_txt_silu),
    pool=self.GLOBAL_GRAPH_POOL_HANDLE,
)
```

- Validation: design history; prefer the reland in #20810 for current work.

### #19521 - Qwen diffusion model detectors

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19521
- State: open, `1` file, `+22/-1`
- Motivation: local directories whose names do not contain canonical HF IDs could not be resolved by the diffusion registry.
- Key implementation: add pipeline-class detectors for Qwen-Image, Qwen-Image-Edit, Qwen-Image-Edit-Plus, Qwen-Image-Layered, and GLM-Image.
- Code:

```python
model_detectors=[
    lambda pipeline_class: "qwenimagepipeline" in pipeline_class.lower()
],
```

```python
model_detectors=[
    lambda pipeline_class: "qwenimageeditpluspipeline" in pipeline_class.lower()
],
```

- Validation: test local paths such as `/models/foobar`.

### #20429 - Fused LayerNorm + scale/shift/gate select01

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/20429
- State: open, `2` files, `+350/-22`
- Motivation: `_modulate()` ran residual, LayerNorm, select01, and modulation as separate kernels.
- Key implementation: add Triton `_fused_modulate_kernel` that optionally computes residual, applies LayerNorm, selects modulation params by index, and writes output/gate.
- Code:

```python
@triton.jit
def _fused_modulate_kernel(..., HAS_RESIDUAL: tl.constexpr):
    residual_out = gate_x * x + residual
    mean = tl.sum(x_for_norm, axis=0) / C
    y = x_hat * (1.0 + scale) + shift
```

```python
if _FUSE_LN_SCALE_SHIFT_SELECT01:
    x, residual_out, gate_result = fused_modulate_kernel(...)
```

- Validation: fixed-seed fused/unfused image comparison plus fp16/residual-path checks.

### #20432 - Dual-stream forward

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/20432
- State: open, `1` file, `+232/-26`
- Motivation: on B200, text qkv/feedforward can overlap with image qkv/feedforward. PR body reports `7.83s -> 7.63s`; H200 gains were trivial, so it is env-gated.
- Key implementation: add `QWEN_IMAGE_DUAL_STREAM_FORWARD`, high-priority stream, image/text QKV helpers, and post-attention image MLP overlap.
- Code:

```python
_DUAL_STREAM_FORWARD = os.environ.get("QWEN_IMAGE_DUAL_STREAM_FORWARD", "0") == "1"
```

```python
with self.device_module.stream(high_priority_stream):
    img_query, img_key, img_value = _get_qkv_projections_img(self, hidden_states)
...
main_stream.wait_stream(high_priority_stream)
```

- Validation: benchmark per GPU family; B200 gains do not automatically transfer to H200.

### #20447 - TeaCache

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/20447
- State: open, `8` files, `+295/-105`
- Motivation: TeaCache skips denoise work by reusing residuals when timestep-conditioned changes are small. PR body reports Qwen-Image-2512 `156.12s -> 61.29s`.
- Key implementation: add Qwen/GLM/Flux TeaCache params, read `enable_teacache` from forward context, support CFG branch separation, and wrap Qwen-Image blocks with skip/finalize hooks.
- Code:

```python
@dataclass
class QwenImageTeaCacheParams(TeaCacheParams):
    teacache_thresh: float = 0.2
    coefficients: list[float] = field(default_factory=lambda: [...])
```

```python
skip, hs_or_orig = self.teacache_skip_or_prepare(hidden_states, temb)
if skip:
    hidden_states = hs_or_orig
else:
    ...
    self.teacache_finalize(hidden_states, hs_or_orig)
```

- Validation: save images and latency; TeaCache is a quality/speed tradeoff.

### #20810 - Reland Qwen-Image CUDA graph

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/20810
- State: open, `4` files, `+681/-47`
- Motivation: reland #19516 with safer graph cache, static input pools, text buckets, and replay signature checks.
- Key implementation: add `CudaGraphCallableCache`, `SharedStaticInputPool`, text bucket selection, graph wrappers around block pre/post attention, and mutual exclusion with torch.compile.
- Code:

```python
class CudaGraphCallableCache:
    def capture_or_replay(...):
        with torch.cuda.graph(graph, pool=self._get_pool_handle()):
            output = fn(*static_inputs)
        ...
        entry.graph.replay()
        return entry.output
```

```python
if self.enable_torch_compile and self.enable_cuda_graph:
    raise ValueError(
        "--enable-torch-compile and --enable-cuda-graph are mutually exclusive for diffusion runtime"
    )
```

- Validation: prefer this graph design; test bucket fallback, graph memory, and image equality.

### #21988 - Multi-output condition batch fix

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/21988
- State: open, `1` file, `+45/-2`
- Motivation: `num_outputs_per_prompt > 1` expanded latent samples but not text condition batches, causing denoise shape mismatch.
- Key implementation: repeat-interleave prompt and negative-prompt embeddings to `batch.batch_size`.
- Code:

```python
repeat_factor = target_batch_size // current_batch_size
return tensor.repeat_interleave(repeat_factor, dim=0).contiguous()
```

- Validation: test `num_outputs_per_prompt=1/2/4/8` and separate denoise success from VAE OOM.

### #22362 - Qwen-Image-Layered serve fix

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22362
- State: open, `2` files, `+4/-2`
- Motivation: `/v1/images/edits` required `prompt` even when Qwen-Image-Layered did not need it; RGBA outputs failed when saved as JPEG.
- Key implementation: default prompt to `" "` and default output extension to PNG.
- Code:

```python
prompt: str = Form(" ")
```

```python
return "png"
```

- Validation: test CLI and server layered/RGBA outputs.

### #22397 - Weight-name mapping

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22397
- State: open, `1` file, `+20/-0`
- Motivation: checkpoints may save `attn.to_out.weight` while SGLang exposes `attn.to_out.0.weight`; added Q/K/V projections may be split.
- Key implementation: map flat `to_out` to indexed `to_out.0`, and merge `add_q/k/v_proj` into `to_added_qkv` with shard ids 0/1/2.
- Code:

```python
r"^(transformer_blocks\.[0-9]+\.attn\.to_out)\.(weight|bias)$": r"\1.0.\2",
r"^(transformer_blocks\.(\d+)\.attn)\.add_q_proj\.(.+)$": (
    r"\1.to_added_qkv.\3",
    0,
    3,
),
```

- Validation: loader tests should cover flat/indexed `to_out` and split/fused added QKV.

### #22953 - Avoid Qwen-Image RoPE illegal memory access

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22953
- State: open, `1` file, `+12/-0`
- Motivation: too many input images or long prompts can make text sequence length exceed RoPE cache length, causing CUDA illegal memory access.
- Key implementation: check required text length against RoPE text cache before entering the kernel and raise a clear `ValueError`.
- Code:

```python
if max_txt_seq_len > txt_cache_len:
    overflow = max_txt_seq_len - txt_cache_len
    raise ValueError(
        "QwenImage RoPE text cache overflow before denoising: "
        f"required_txt_seq_len={max_txt_seq_len}, txt_cache_len={txt_cache_len}, "
        f"overflow={overflow}. "
    )
```

- Validation: long prompt / many-image requests should fail fast before corrupting CUDA context.

### #23155 - ModelOpt FP8

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/23155
- State: open, `4` files, `+210/-33`
- Motivation: Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit need ModelOpt FP8 support, but naive FP8 caused severe dark/blurred image regression.
- Key implementation: make Qwen-Image DiT projections quant-aware, replace Diffusers FeedForward with `QwenImageFeedForward`, add Qwen BF16 fallback patterns, canonicalize modulation names, and write BF16 fallback tensors before ModelOpt ignored-weight preservation.
- Code:

```python
self.to_q = ReplicatedLinear(
    dim,
    self.inner_dim,
    bias=True,
    quant_config=quant_config,
    prefix=f"{prefix}.to_q",
)
```

```python
DEFAULT_QWEN_IMAGE_KEEP_BF16_PATTERNS = [
    r"^img_in$",
    r"^txt_in$",
    r"^time_text_embed\.timestep_embedder\.linear_[12]$",
    r"^norm_out\.linear$",
    r"^proj_out$",
    r"^transformer_blocks\.\d+\.img_mlp\.net\.2$",
    r"^transformer_blocks\.\d+\.(img_mod|txt_mod)$",
]
```

```python
if name in fallback_tensors:
    shard_tensors[name] = fallback_tensors[name]
    continue
```

- Validation: BF16-vs-FP8 image comparison, benchmark JSON, and profiler artifacts are required for both Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit.

## Validation Matrix

- Fixed prompt/seed/resolution/steps BF16 text-to-image.
- Fixed image/prompt BF16 edit.
- CUDA graph on/off including text bucket fallback.
- TeaCache on/off with saved images and latency.

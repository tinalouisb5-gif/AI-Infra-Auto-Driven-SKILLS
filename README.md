This repo is not a prompt dump. It combines a small set of core operational
skills with a model-family optimization catalog for AI infrastructure agents
that need to make concrete progress on SGLang, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM work:
benchmark fairly, read upstream PRs with diff evidence, profile kernels, debug
serving incidents, and keep model-family optimization knowledge reusable.

If these runbooks save you a failed benchmark run, a stale model-support
assumption, or a late-night production triage loop, a star helps more AI-infra
engineers find the project.

## Why Star This Repo

| Highlight | What it helps with |
| --- | --- |
| 7 core operational skills | Reuse battle-tested workflows for benchmarking, profiling, diagrams, incidents, SOTA loops, and H100 operations. |
| Model optimization catalog | Browse framework-specific model-family runbooks under `skills/model-optimization/` without treating each model page as a core skill. |
| SGLang, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM coverage | Compare serving stacks with the same workload, SLA, and evidence format. |
| Diff-backed model PR dossiers | Track why model-support PRs landed, what code changed, and what risks remain. |
| Profiler-to-action playbooks | Turn torch-profiler traces into kernel, overlap, and fusion opportunities. |
| Replay-first production triage | Preserve the evidence trail while debugging real SGLang serving incidents. |
| Public model architecture gallery | Resolve original architecture diagrams for popular LLM, VLM, MoE, OCR, and diffusion families. |

Run each skill's `ls` to see its exact current file set; this overview is a
high-level map, not a line-level inventory.

Model PR histories are framework-scoped:

```text

├── sglang/
│   ├── model-skill-pr-dossier-quality-scan-2026-04-23.md
│   ├── model-skill-pr-dossier-quality-scan-2026-04-24.md

```

## Placeholders

The `h100` and `h100-sglang-diffusion` skills document a concrete remote
environment (SSH alias `h100_sglang`, container `sglang_bbuf`, repo paths
`/sgl-workspace/sglang` and `/data/bbuf/repos/sglang`) because they are the
operator's own runbooks. Only secret-shaped values are templated with
placeholders that you must replace before running:

| Placeholder       | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<your-hf-token>` | Hugging Face access token (never commit the real value) |

When adapting these skills to a different host/container/repo layout, copy the
SKILL and replace the concrete SSH alias, Docker name, and workspace path in
one pass rather than introducing generic `<...>` placeholders that drift out of
sync.

## Model Optimization Catalog

Model-family material is organized as a catalog rather than counted as core
operational skills. Use the skill page when you want an agent runbook, and the
history page when you want the diff-backed PR evolution notes for the same
model family.

| Framework | Agent runbooks | Bilingual PR histories |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SGLang | [`skills/model-optimization/sglang/`](skills/model-optimization/sglang/) | [`model-pr-optimization-history/sglang/`](model-pr-optimization-history/sglang/) |
| vLLM | [`skills/model-optimization/vllm/`](skills/model-optimization/vllm/) | [`model-pr-optimization-history/vllm/`](model-pr-optimization-history/vllm/) |
| Shared standard | [`model-pr-diff-dossier`](skills/model-optimization/model-pr-diff-dossier/) | Cross-family audit notes live beside the framework history directories. |

Covered model families are listed once here; exact skill directory names may
carry framework prefixes or newer model-version qualifiers.

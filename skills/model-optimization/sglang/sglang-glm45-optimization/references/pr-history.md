### PR #8224 - GLM-4.5 Model Support

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8224
- State: merged at `2025-07-28T18:10:23Z`, merge commit `6d6a8bc278eac424214e73544ae010bde3fb99cb`
- Diff stats: `14` files, `+1673/-7`
- Diff coverage: the full PR diff is large, so the GLM model, NextN, detector, config, server-args, and parser-registry hunks were searched and read around `EntryClass`, `Glm4MoeForCausalLM`, `Glm4MoeForCausalLMNextN`, `Glm4MoeDetector`, `reasoning_parser`, and model-architecture mapping.
- Motivation: this is the first GLM-4.5 bring-up. SGLang needed a text MoE class, MTP/NextN draft model, GLM tool-call detector, reasoning/parser aliases, and config hooks before later GLM-4.5-Air, GLM-4.6, GLM-4.7, and GLM-5 work could reuse the GLM4-MoE path.
- Key implementation: `Glm4MoeForCausalLM` mirrors the DeepSeek MoE architecture where possible but registers a GLM-specific model family, GLM router/gate, sparse MoE block, and shared-expert fusion decision. `Glm4MoeForCausalLMNextN` adapts the same weights for draft decoding. The detector registers the XML-like GLM tool format and the config path rewrites draft architectures to NextN when needed.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
if is_draft_model and self.hf_config.architectures[0] == "Glm4MoeForCausalLM":
    self.hf_config.architectures[0] = "Glm4MoeForCausalLMNextN"
```

```python
class Glm4MoeForCausalLM(DeepseekV2ForCausalLM):
    ...
    self.determine_num_fused_shared_experts("Glm4MoeForCausalLM")

EntryClass = [Glm4MoeForCausalLM]
```

```python
class Glm4MoeForCausalLMNextN(Glm4MoeForCausalLM):
    def load_weights(self, weights, is_nextn=True):
        super().load_weights(weights, is_nextn=True)

EntryClass = [Glm4MoeForCausalLMNextN]
```

```python
"glm45": Glm4MoeDetector
```

- Validation implications: every GLM-4.5 change should smoke-test base MoE, NextN/MTP, `--reasoning-parser glm45`, `--tool-call-parser glm45`, shared expert fusion, TP/EP, and FP8/NVFP4 load separately.

### PR #8456 - fix GLM4_MOE launch with compressed_tensor quant model

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8456
- State: merged at `2025-07-28T21:19:52Z`, merge commit `25f73c6cf3c2b20441266693ad12030157c1cbef`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+1/-0`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: `zai-org/GLM-4.5-Air-FP8` / compressed-tensors checkpoints failed at launch because GLM shared-expert fusion accepted FP8 and blockwise-int8 quantization names but not `compressed_tensors`.
- Key implementation: the quantization allowlist for shared-expert fusion now includes `compressed_tensors`; the PR body reports GSM8K accuracy `0.935` and output throughput `1582.320 tok/s` after the fix.
- Key code excerpt:

```diff
 elif (
     self.quant_config.get_name() == "fp8"
     or self.quant_config.get_name() == "blockwise_int8"
+    or self.quant_config.get_name() == "compressed_tensors"
 ):
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: compressed-tensors GLM-4.5-Air startup should be part of the GLM quantized smoke matrix, not only FP8/NVFP4.

### PR #8647 - Disable tp for shared experts under expert parallelism for GLM4.5 model

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8647
- State: merged at `2025-08-01T21:20:52Z`, merge commit `2ae95d17e80710d5ed1189398f36905ad43f5baa`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+73/-5`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.5 FP8 per-block launch with `--tp 8 --enable-ep-moe` failed because shared experts were still tensor-parallel sharded under expert parallelism. The gate/up projection output size `192` was not divisible by FP8 block size `128`.
- Key implementation: GLM shared experts record MoE EP world size and construct shared-expert linears with `tp_rank=0, tp_size=1` when EP is active. Forward ordering is split so all-reduce and shared-output addition happen correctly for EP and non-EP paths. The PR body reports GSM8K accuracy `0.955` and output throughput `479.302 tok/s`.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
self.ep_size = get_moe_expert_parallel_world_size()
...
**(dict(tp_rank=0, tp_size=1) if self.ep_size > 1 else {}),
```

```python
if self.ep_size > 1:
    if self.tp_size > 1 and not can_fuse_mlp_allreduce:
        final_hidden_states = tensor_model_parallel_all_reduce(final_hidden_states)
    if shared_output is not None:
        final_hidden_states += shared_output
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: EP+TP FP8 per-block GLM-4.5-Air is the target regression. Verify shared-output addition and all-reduce order under `--enable-ep-moe`.

### PR #8729 - use fp32 for e_score_correction_bias in GLM-4.5

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8729
- State: merged at `2025-08-03T05:53:55Z`, merge commit `760286e3d378780546b88c6d9e932bc178d39669`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+1/-1`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: the GLM gate score correction bias should remain FP32 to match training/runtime numerical behavior; lower precision can perturb top-k routing.
- Key implementation: the gate parameter allocation fixes `dtype=torch.float32` regardless of the surrounding model dtype.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
self.e_score_correction_bias = nn.Parameter(
    torch.empty((config.n_routed_experts), dtype=torch.float32)
)
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: compare router/top-k stability on GLM-4.5 BF16 and FP8; this is a small numeric fix with potentially large routing impact.

### PR #8804 - GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air both support

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8804
- State: merged at `2025-08-05T03:32:20Z`, merge commit `a4b0d5c9e5cb2b36eacdc30bc9259a213cd17a16`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+1/-2`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: the original shared-expert fusion decision was too tied to a single routed-expert count. GLM-4.5-Air has a different expert layout and should not be disabled by the earlier hard-coded `n_routed_experts != 128` guard.
- Key implementation: `determine_num_fused_shared_experts()` defaults to `Glm4MoeForCausalLM` and removes the routed-expert-count guard.
- Key code excerpt:

```diff
-        self, architecture: str = "DeepseekV3ForCausalLM"
+        self, architecture: str = "Glm4MoeForCausalLM"
...
-            or self.config.n_routed_experts != 128
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: run shared-expert fusion on both GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air; do not infer support from expert count alone.

### PR #8883 - fix glm4 moe

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/8883
- State: merged at `2025-08-07T16:12:43Z`, merge commit `5b6acc1495f4c4d44bfdb0ce8090426de280b002`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+19/-4`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM4 inherited DeepSeek-style MoE logic, but an upstream DeepSeek update around reduce-scatter and the layer communicator was not mirrored into GLM; logits became incorrect in DP/TP communicator modes.
- Key implementation: `forward_normal` and `forward_normal_dual_stream` accept `use_reduce_scatter`; tensor-parallel all-reduce is skipped when reduce-scatter owns the reduction. `LayerCommunicator` is initially allowed to reduce-scatter, though later #11665 disables it for GLM45 after more failures.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
if (
    self.tp_size > 1
    and not can_fuse_mlp_allreduce
    and not use_reduce_scatter
):
    final_hidden_states = tensor_model_parallel_all_reduce(final_hidden_states)
```

```python
LayerCommunicator(..., allow_reduce_scatter=True)
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: treat this as historical context. If touching reduce-scatter today, also read #11665 because it supersedes the permissive setting for GLM45.

### PR #9136 - [DP Attention] Refactor: adding some utility functions

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/9136
- State: merged at `2025-08-14T16:24:37Z`, merge commit `b87aacb5c55d673ead0a2bc501a58f7d02a5e2cd`
- Diff stats: `21` files, `+216/-159`
- Diff coverage: DP-attention buffer, flag, logits, and GLM/DeepSeek call-site hunks reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM MoE with DP attention needed gathered buffers and DP state to be accessible without relying on `global_server_args_dict["enable_dp_attention"]`. The PR generalized DP utility functions and cleaned the naming.
- Key implementation: DP attention exposes global/local DP buffers and an initialized `is_dp_attention_enabled()` flag. Later dispatcher and MoE code use these helpers instead of directly looking at server-args globals.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
def get_global_dp_buffer() -> torch.Tensor:
    return _DpGatheredBufferWrapper.get_global_dp_buffer()

def get_local_dp_buffer() -> torch.Tensor:
    return _DpGatheredBufferWrapper.get_local_dp_buffer()
```

```python
def is_dp_attention_enabled():
    assert _ENABLE_DP_ATTENTION_FLAG is not None, "dp attention not initialized!"
    return _ENABLE_DP_ATTENTION_FLAG
```

- Reviewed files: DP attention helpers, logits processor, model runner, DeepSeek/GLM adjacent call sites.
- Validation implications: GLM-4.5 DP attention smoke should include cuda graph and logits processor gather behavior.

### PR #9223 - Cleanup MoE Refactor

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/9223
- State: merged at `2025-08-15T16:10:38Z`, merge commit `84b006b27833d93045ae5552e2cebb13f5140ab5`
- Diff stats: `3` files, `+18/-16`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: MoE refactor introduced a `TopKOutput` object. GLM4 MoE needed to stop passing router logits/top-k tensors as separate ad hoc arguments and follow the shared FusedMoE interface.
- Key implementation: GLM and DeepSeek sparse MoE now compute `topk_output = self.topk(...)` and pass the object into `self.experts`. The MXFP4 TRT-LLM path asserts that its bypassed format is present before reading `topk_config.top_k` and `router_logits`.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
topk_output = self.topk(hidden_states, router_logits)
final_hidden_states = self.experts(hidden_states, topk_output)
```

```python
assert TopKOutputChecker.format_is_bypassed(topk_output)
top_k = topk_output.topk_config.top_k
router_logits = topk_output.router_logits
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/deepseek_v2.py`, `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`, MXFP4 MoE method.
- Validation implications: GLM4 MoE breakages after MoE refactors often show up as top-k format mismatches; inspect the `TopKOutput` contract first.

### PR #9264 - Quick Fix GLM

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/9264
- State: merged at `2025-08-17T14:21:48Z`, merge commit `e47800e176b86d7d95309ab23d6cb3bd76d6c2be`
- Diff stats: `2` files, `+6/-1`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM inference failed after pipeline-parallel assumptions changed in #8846. The nightly GSM8K threshold also used the wrong benchmark path, so the threshold was not calibrated to actual `simple_eval_mgsm.py` behavior.
- Key implementation: GLM model and wrapper get PP group metadata plus `start_layer`/`end_layer`; nightly threshold for `zai-org/GLM-4.5-Air-FP8` changes from `0.94` to `0.78`.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
self.pp_group = get_pp_group()
self.start_layer = 0
self.end_layer = config.num_hidden_layers
```

```diff
-"zai-org/GLM-4.5-Air-FP8": 0.94,
+"zai-org/GLM-4.5-Air-FP8": 0.78,
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`, nightly eval threshold config.
- Validation implications: pipeline-parallel metadata is not optional for GLM; quick PP smoke is useful after model wrapper edits.

### PR #10008 - Optimized deepseek-v3/r1 model performance on mxfp4 run

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/10008
- State: merged at `2025-09-04T21:58:55Z`, merge commit `e96973742c326a129da772a115bdeb925643d95a`
- Diff stats: `8` files, `+489/-67`
- Diff coverage: DeepSeek MXFP4/AITER hunk plus GLM4 MoE signature compatibility hunk reviewed.
- Motivation: this PR primarily targets DeepSeek MXFP4 performance on AMD by fusing activation quantization into activation/layernorm/GEMM/flatten paths, but a later patch explicitly fixed GLM-4.5-Air breakage caused by shared DeepSeek/GLM method signature drift.
- Key implementation: `SiluAndMul` can return fused MXFP4 prequant output; Quark W4A4 MXFP4 supports prequant tuple input; GLM4 MoE forward functions accept `gemm_output_zero_allocator` so the shared DeepSeek MXFP4/AITER call chain remains compatible.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
def forward_cuda(self, x: torch.Tensor, fused_mxfp4_prequant: Optional[bool] = False):
    if fused_mxfp4_prequant:
        out = act_mul_and_mxfp4_quant(x, "silu")
```

```python
def forward_normal(
    self,
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,

- Validation implications: GLM-4.5-Air should launch after shared DeepSeek quant/kernel signature changes, even when the PR title does not mention GLM.

### PR #11017 - Update GLM-4.5 Model Doc

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/11017
- State: merged at `2025-09-28T12:41:37Z`, merge commit `abb6781573a86c7e7b22e41fd2924094a7d4a135`
- Diff stats: `5` files, `+11/-12`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: by this point GLM-4.6 reused the GLM-4.5 parser/runtime shape. Docs and router mappings needed to describe the shared GLM-4.5/4.6 lane instead of treating GLM-4.5 as a one-off.
- Key implementation: GLM detector/model docstrings become GLM-4.5/4.6; the Rust router maps `glm-4.5*` and `glm-4.6*` to `glm4_moe`; parser docs are updated.
- Key code excerpt:

```rust
self.map_model("glm-4.5*", "glm4_moe");
self.map_model("glm-4.6*", "glm4_moe");
```

- Reviewed files: router mapping, GLM parser README, GLM docs.
- Validation implications: parser auto-selection should keep `glm45` semantics for GLM-4.5/4.6 and not confuse later GLM-4.7 parser behavior.

### PR #11665 - fix(glm45): disable reduce scatter

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/11665
- State: merged at `2025-10-18T10:57:28Z`, merge commit `f7ab9554554fbd3d07ffa4ad34c5fcbef69591b6`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+1/-1`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM45 MoE still did not support reduce-scatter safely even after the earlier #8883 compatibility patch. Keeping it enabled at `LayerCommunicator` caused runtime correctness/stability risk.
- Key implementation: `allow_reduce_scatter` is set to `False` for GLM45.
- Key code excerpt:

```diff
-            allow_reduce_scatter=True,
+            allow_reduce_scatter=False,
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: this PR supersedes #8883 for today’s behavior. Do not re-enable reduce-scatter for GLM45 without a dedicated correctness and throughput matrix.

### PR #11692 - Fix missing a2a backend init of GLM4.5 MoE Block

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/11692
- State: merged at `2025-10-16T16:45:48Z`, merge commit `476c67d7fcfea316f23d24afe90a8f679f0490a4`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+4/-2`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.5 MoE block missed A2A backend initialization on some code paths. CI caught the failure after Mooncake/DeepEP backend abstraction moved beyond a DeepEP-only flag.
- Key implementation: the model checks `get_moe_a2a_backend().is_deepep()` or `.is_mooncake()` and renames the internal switch to `_enable_a2a_moe`.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
if get_moe_a2a_backend().is_deepep() or get_moe_a2a_backend().is_mooncake():
    ...
self._enable_a2a_moe = (
    get_moe_a2a_backend().is_deepep() or get_moe_a2a_backend().is_mooncake()
)
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`
- Validation implications: always test both DeepEP and Mooncake A2A naming paths; `deepep` in a variable name may hide a broader A2A contract.

### PR #11800 - Refactoring GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5V related implementations

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/11800
- State: merged at `2025-10-24T13:13:11Z`, merge commit `4060ed37cb67262b0cc7af2bcbbdf37ba12d3501`
- Diff stats: `4` files, `+356/-565`
- Diff coverage: GLM text MoE, GLM4V MoE, PP, shared-expert, and NextN hunks reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5V had inherited too much directly from DeepSeek-V2; that inheritance made shared-expert, PP, VLM, and future GLM changes fragile.
- Key implementation: GLM defines its own `Glm4MoeSparseMoeBlock`, `Glm4MoeDecoderLayer`, and `Glm4MoeModel` while still reusing shared layers. The model becomes PP-aware through `make_layers`, `PPMissingLayer`, and `PPProxyTensors`; GLM4V MoE is simplified to reuse the GLM text model. The patch briefly restored `allow_reduce_scatter=True`, which #11665 later disables.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
class Glm4MoeSparseMoeBlock(nn.Module):
    self.topk = TopK(
        top_k=self.top_k + self.num_fused_shared_experts,
        layer_id=self.layer_id,

- Diff stats: `24` files, `+394/-428`
- Diff coverage: dispatcher interface, DP attention state, DeepEP/Mooncake, and GLM import/call-site hunks reviewed.
- Motivation: standard, DeepEP, and Mooncake dispatchers were carrying inconsistent signatures and forward-batch state. GLM4 MoE depends on this interface whenever A2A or overlap modes are used.
- Key implementation: dispatcher `dispatch/combine` paths move to `TopKOutput`; extend/decode state is stored in DP attention helpers via `set_is_extend_in_batch`; `DeepEPMoE.forward()` accepts `TopKOutput`.
- Key code excerpts:

### PR #12162 - [Feature] Enable return routed experts

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/12162
- State: merged at `2025-12-21T10:10:06Z`, merge commit `bed301a5acaa9577c9aa706468bdf242f6a43051`
- Diff stats: `27` files, `+646/-10`
- Diff coverage: capturer, scheduler/model-runner hooks, FusedMoE capture point, detokenizer, and GLM4 MoE patch hunks reviewed.
- Motivation: RL and training-alignment workflows need routed expert IDs/top-k output from inference, and models such as DeepSeek V3.2, MiMo, R3, and GLM-like MoE paths benefit from matching training/inference routing information.
- Key implementation: `RoutedExpertsCapturer` is created from `--enable-return-routed-experts`; FusedMoE captures `topk_output` per layer; detokenizer returns base64-encoded int32 expert IDs. A later patch in the PR fixes GLM4 MoE by removing a duplicate `TopK` construction and restoring `layer_id`.

self.routed_experts_capturer = RoutedExpertsCapturer.create(
    get_global_server_args().enable_return_routed_experts

### PR #12456 - Handle escaped characters in GLM tool call parser to prevent double serialization

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/12456
- State: merged at `2025-11-05T08:21:07Z`, merge commit `44da737770e4bcd9bfa27751f0a0751c9b5c06e1`
- Diff stats: `2` files, `+127/-13`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM tool-call output can contain literal escaped characters such as `\n` or `\"`. The old regex/parser failed these values, causing BaseFormatDetector fallback serialization and double escaping.
- Key implementation: regex supports both real newlines and literal `\\n`; `parse_arguments()` tries direct JSON, JSON-string unescape, JSON reparse, and `ast.literal_eval`.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
self.func_detail_regex = re.compile(
    r"<tool_call>(.*?)(?:\\n|\n)(.*)</tool_call>", re.DOTALL
)
self.func_arg_regex = re.compile(
    r"<arg_key>(.*?)</arg_key>(?:\\n|\s)*<arg_value>(.*?)</arg_value>",
    re.DOTALL,
)
```

### PR #12497 - Remove assertion for padding for NVFP4 weight scales to fix GLM 4.5 NVFP4

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/12497
- State: merged at `2026-01-15T19:21:34Z`, merge commit `4346db5fafee11513799ebb57ec3e6ad5d95f6e9`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+7/-4`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: `iAzure/GLM-4.5-NVFP4` failed during `modelopt_fp4` load because `weight_scale.shape[2] % 16 == 0` was asserted even though swizzle padding handles non-16-aligned K-prime dimensions.
- Key implementation: replace hard assertion with a warning when scale K-prime is not a multiple of `4`, preserving load while surfacing unusual layout. PR body reports TP8 GSM8K accuracy `0.945` and throughput `2362.182 tok/s`.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
if weight_scale.shape[assert_dim] % 4 != 0:
    logger.warning(
        "NVFP4 %s_weight_scale K' not multiple of 4: shape=%s, group_size=%s",
        name,

- Reviewed files: NVFP4/modelopt quant loader file.
- Validation implications: GLM-4.5 NVFP4 load should be tested with TP8, GSM8K, and a warning scan rather than expecting perfect scale alignment.

### PR #12572 - Register allgather/reducescatter buffers with symm memory

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/12572
- State: merged at `2025-11-05T16:13:57Z`, merge commit `2340798353bc58398b6d45f582c7c79b670d0256`
- Diff stats: `19` files, `+250/-114`
- Diff coverage: symmetric-memory context, PyNccl collectives, DP buffer, and GLM MoE shared-output allocation hunks reviewed.
- Motivation: all-gather/reduce-scatter buffers used by MoE and tensor-parallel collectives needed to be registered with symmetric memory so overlap and communication paths could use the right allocation guarantees.
- Key implementation: add `use_symmetric_memory()` context manager; PyNccl all-gather/reduce-scatter use custom ops; GLM4 MoE allocates shared-expert output under symmetric memory when appropriate.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
def use_symmetric_memory(group_coordinator: GroupCoordinator, disabled: bool = False):
    disabled = (
        not is_symmetric_memory_enabled()
        or disabled
        or group_coordinator.world_size == 1
    )

### PR #12834 - Refactor KTransformers heterogeneous compute with unified GPU-quantization backend

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/12834
- State: merged at `2025-11-10T04:51:17Z`, merge commit `ddd1440d0f027e85af6be53bbb309683ed7ea2c4`
- Diff stats: `10` files, `+494/-507`
- Diff coverage: KT EP wrapper, server args, quant fallback, and GLM4 MoE routed-scaling branch reviewed.
- Motivation: KTransformers heterogeneous compute had scattered hard-coded paths and environment-variable checks. It needed a unified wrapper that can compose CPU experts with any GPU MoE quantization method.
- Key implementation: `KTEPWrapperMethod` wraps a GPU MoE method and CPU AMX/AVX experts; CPU expert ids are masked out on GPU; CPU computation runs asynchronously while GPU experts execute. GLM4 MoE explicitly checks `KTEPWrapperMethod` when deciding whether to apply routed scaling on output.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
@torch.compile(dynamic=True, backend=get_compiler_backend())
def mask_cpu_expert_ids(topk_ids: torch.Tensor, num_gpu_experts: int) -> torch.Tensor:
    topk_ids = topk_ids.clone()
    topk_ids[topk_ids >= num_gpu_experts] = -1
    return topk_ids
```

```python
class KTEPWrapperMethod(FusedMoEMethodBase):
    self.gpu_method.create_weights(
        layer=layer,
        num_experts=self.num_gpu_experts,

### PR #12957 - clean redundant code in previous PR

- State: merged at `2025-11-10T05:40:32Z`, merge commit `9cfe78dd3076749c9ac1eec0a91d941d3d3a76c7`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+0/-37`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: #12834 left a redundant `forward_normal_dual_stream()` implementation in `glm4_moe.py`. Keeping duplicate forward paths around GLM routed scaling, symmetric memory, and all-reduce made future MoE changes easier to patch in one path but forget in another.
- Key implementation: delete the extra method and the now-unused `KTEPWrapperMethod` import.
- Key code excerpt:

```diff
-from sglang.srt.layers.moe.kt_ep_wrapper import KTEPWrapperMethod
...

### PR #13786 - Overlap glm moe gemms in two cuda streams

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/13786
- State: merged at `2025-11-25T02:15:24Z`, merge commit `4b45d556a7e66d1d978e6df14098a8ba87606a4b`
- Diff stats: `1` file, `+47/-3`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM MoE shared experts and routed experts can be overlapped on two CUDA streams when graph capture is active. PR body reports GLM-4.6-FP8 single-concurrency output speed improving from `60.40` to `66.31 token/s` and GSM8K accuracy `0.952`.
- Key implementation: the GLM sparse MoE forward chooses `forward_normal_dual_stream()` only when `alt_stream` exists, hidden states are non-empty, and cuda-graph capture is active. The dual stream computes shared experts on the current stream while routed experts run on `alt_stream`, then synchronizes and adds outputs.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
if (
    self.alt_stream is not None
    and hidden_states.shape[0] > 0
    and get_is_capture_mode()
):
    return self.forward_normal_dual_stream(
        hidden_states, should_allreduce_fusion, use_reduce_scatter

### PR #13873 - Feat: GLM-4.6 supports shared experts fusion

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/13873
- State: merged at `2025-12-01T03:33:18Z`, merge commit `982db4ebac260ef4b0597796541724c81a78fe94`
- Diff stats: `7` files, `+252/-24`
- Diff coverage: benchmark config, fused-MoE config lookup, `glm4_moe.py`, and NextN hunks reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.6 shared the GLM4-MoE lineage and needed shared experts fused into routed experts for better latency. Even though the PR title names GLM-4.6, the implementation changes the shared `glm4_moe.py` path used as GLM-4.5’s baseline.
- Key implementation: GLM4 MoE represents the shared expert as one extra expert slot. Top-k increases by `num_fused_shared_experts`, FusedMoE receives `num_fused_shared_experts`, and weight loading remaps `mlp.shared_experts` into `mlp.experts.{n_routed_experts}`. Fused-MoE config lookup passes `per_channel_quant` and adds H200 config for `E=161,N=192`.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
self.experts = get_moe_impl_class(quant_config)(
    num_experts=config.n_routed_experts + self.num_fused_shared_experts,
    num_fused_shared_experts=self.num_fused_shared_experts,
    top_k=self.top_k + self.num_fused_shared_experts,

```python
if self.num_fused_shared_experts > 0 and "mlp.shared_experts" in name:
    name = name.replace(
        "mlp.shared_experts",

    )
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe.py`, `python/sglang/srt/models/glm4_moe_nextn.py`, fused-MoE config files and lookup.

### PR #13989 - Fix GLM-4.6 tool calls don't support streaming output for arguments

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/13989
- State: merged at `2025-12-13T08:37:18Z`, merge commit `80554598d33b68636be645856fce43403c7be1cb`
- Diff stats: `2` files, `+527/-81`
- Diff coverage: full `glm4_moe_detector.py` diff and function-call parser tests reviewed.
- Motivation: the old GLM4-MoE detector waited for a complete `</tool_call>` and reparsed the full XML block, so streaming tool-call arguments were not emitted character-by-character. This hurt OpenAI-compatible streaming UX for GLM-4.5/4.6.
- Key implementation: add a `StreamState` state machine that converts `<arg_key>/<arg_value>` XML fragments into JSON increments. The parser sends tool name first, tracks `_streamed_raw_length`, buffers partial tags, and emits parameter chunks as soon as they are safe.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
class StreamState(str, Enum):
    INIT = "INIT"
    BETWEEN = "BETWEEN"
    IN_KEY = "IN_KEY"
    WAITING_VALUE = "WAITING_VALUE"
    IN_VALUE = "IN_VALUE"

raw_increment = func_args_raw[self._streamed_raw_length :]
json_increment = self._process_xml_to_json_streaming(
    raw_increment, func_name, tools

### PR #14668 - [NVIDIA] Add flashinfer all-to-all MOE dispatcher

- Diff stats: `14` files, `+723/-16`
- Diff coverage: dispatcher, server-args, env var, modelopt quant, DeepSeek/GLM call sites, and tests reviewed.
- Motivation: FlashInfer added one-sided NVLink all-to-all kernels for throughput MoE serving. SGLang needed a `--moe-a2a-backend=flashinfer` path, especially for FlashInfer CUTLASS MoE and FP4/NVFP4 communication.
- Key implementation: add `FlashinferDispatcher`, `FlashinferDispatchOutput`, `MoeA2ABackend.FLASHINFER`, server-arg handling that ties EP size to TP size and auto-enables `SGLANG_MOE_NVFP4_DISPATCH`, and GLM4 MoE shared-expert TP-size special casing when FlashInfer A2A is active.
- Key code excerpts:

- Diff stats: `7` files, `+809/-394`
- Diff coverage: GLM docs, parser registry, new `glm47_moe_detector.py`, and GLM function-call parser tests reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.7 changed tool-call formatting enough that reusing `glm45` would be ambiguous. SGLang needed a separate `glm47` parser while keeping GLM-4.5/4.6 on `glm45`.
- Key implementation: docs explicitly state GLM-4.7 should use `--tool-call-parser glm47` while GLM-4.5/4.6 use `glm45`; parser registry adds `Glm47MoeDetector`; the new detector handles `<tool_call>name<arg_key>...` without the GLM45 newline after the tool name.

- Diff stats: `4` files, `+869/-20`
- Diff coverage: `glm47_moe_detector.py`, `glm4_moe_detector.py`, shared function-call utility, and tests reviewed.
- Motivation: complex JSON Schema definitions such as `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, enum-only schemas, and OpenAI-style type arrays caused array/object values to be parsed as strings. Although the title names GLM-4.7, the fix also patches GLM4/GLM45 detector type inference.
- Key implementation: shared `infer_type_from_json_schema()` infers primary parameter type; both GLM45 and GLM47 detectors call it. Streaming value detection also tries JSON parse before heuristic fallback so arrays/objects remain JSON.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
from sglang.srt.function_call.utils import infer_type_from_json_schema

- Diff stats: `4` files, `+1513/-140`
- Diff coverage: GLM45/GLM47 detector error-handling hunks and boundary tests reviewed.
- Motivation: during streaming, the model can emit only `<tool_call>` or partial tags before the function name exists. GLM parsers raised `AssertionError` for empty function names and `AttributeError` when calling `.strip()` on `None`.
- Key implementation: add safe `getattr`/dict navigation, helper methods for extracting regex groups, deferred tool-name emission until the function name is complete, and `_streamed_raw_length` updates even when a chunk produces no JSON output.

- Diff stats: `2` files, `+238/-3`
- Diff coverage: full reasoning parser diff and GLM45 tests reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.5 can switch from reasoning to tool call without emitting an explicit closing `</think>` tag. The old base detector expected `think_end_token`, so `<think>...<tool_call>` was parsed as truncated reasoning instead of reasoning plus normal/tool text.
- Key implementation: `BaseReasoningFormatDetector` gets optional `tool_start_token`; `Glm45Detector` uses `<think>`, `</think>`, and `<tool_call>`. Non-streaming and streaming paths split at tool start if the explicit end token is absent.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
if (
    in_reasoning
    and self.tool_start_token is not None
    and self.tool_start_token in processed_text

- Diff coverage: full GLM/VLM fused-MoE config diff reviewed.
- Motivation: GLM-4.5-Air and GLM-4.5V need tuned fused-MoE Triton configs for 2x RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Edition, especially FP8 W8A8 TP2 shapes.
- Key implementation: add `Glm4vMoeForConditionalGeneration` handling to fused-MoE benchmark config and add RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell JSON configs for `E=128,N=704` and `E=129,N=704` under Triton `3.4.0` and `3.5.1`.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
not in [
    "DeepseekV3ForCausalLM",
    "Glm4MoeForCausalLM",
    "Glm4vMoeForConditionalGeneration",
    "MistralLarge3ForCausalLM",

  }
}
```

- Reviewed files: fused-MoE benchmark utility and RTX Pro 6000 config JSON files.
- Validation implications: keep it as open hardware-tuning radar. Run TP2 GLM-4.5-Air and GLM-4.5V on RTX Pro 6000 before copying these configs into a stable playbook.

### PR #19106 - Fix GLM4 MoE Lite CompressedTensors serving and transformers version checks

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19106
- State: open as of `2026-04-23`
- Diff stats: `12` files, `+505/-37`
- Diff coverage: model config, attention backend handler, DeepSeek weight loader, DeepSeek packed mapping, GLM4 MoE, GLM4 MoE Lite, and targeted tests reviewed.
- Motivation: CompressedTensors GLM4 MoE Lite checkpoints such as `GLM-4.7-Flash-REAP-23B-A3B-AWQ-4bit` failed with `AttributeError: 'ReplicatedLinear' object has no attribute 'weight'`; TF version warnings also suggested downgrading even though `glm4_moe_lite` requires Transformers >=5.
- Key implementation: guard fused MLA paths on actual `.weight`; dequantize CT WNA16 packed `kv_b_proj` before MLA post-load `w_kc/w_vc` generation; add packed fused-module mappings for q/kv and gate/up names; disable shared-experts fusion when checkpoint quant config marks shared experts ignored/non-quantized; treat `glm4_moe_lite` as TF>=5-required.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
fused_qkv_a_proj = getattr(attn, "fused_qkv_a_proj_with_mqa", None)
if (
    fused_qkv_a_proj is not None
    and getattr(fused_qkv_a_proj, "weight", None) is not None
    and use_intel_amx_backend(attn)
):
    return AttnForwardMethod.MLA_FUSED_ROPE_CPU
```

```python
def _dequantize_ct_wna16_weight(layer: nn.Module) -> torch.Tensor:
    qweight = unpack_from_int32(layer.weight_packed, num_bits=4, packed_dim=1)
    ...
    return (qweight * scales).reshape(out_features, in_features)
```

```python
elif (
    self.quant_config is not None
    and hasattr(self.quant_config, "ignore")
    and any(".mlp.shared_experts." in item for item in self.quant_config.ignore)
):
    disable_reason = "Shared experts are marked as ignored/non-quantized..."
```

- Reviewed files: `model_config.py`, `attention_backend_handler.py`, `deepseek_weight_loader.py`, `deepseek_v2.py`, `glm4_moe.py`, `glm4_moe_lite.py`, six targeted unit tests.
- Validation implications: this is open but important for GLM-4.5 lineage because it touches shared `glm4_moe.py`. Validate regular AWQ still works, CT WNA16 boots, shared-expert fusion auto-disables only when ignored, and TF>=5 warning logic is correct.

### PR #19728 - Fix ROCm GLM-4.5V-FP8 startup with unpadded MoE weights and padded FP8 fallback

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/19728
- State: open as of `2026-04-23`
- Diff stats: `4` files, `+104/-4`
- Diff coverage: fused-MoE hidden-size guard, HIP FP8 fallback copy helper, and ROCm tests reviewed.
- Motivation: `GLM-4.5V-FP8` on MI300X failed in two places: fused-MoE subtracted global ROCm `SGLANG_MOE_PADDING` even when weights were already unpadded, then HIP native FP8 fallback copied unpadded tensors into padded output/scale buffers.
- Key implementation: skip effective padding adjustment when `hidden_states.shape[1] == w1.shape[2]`; add `_copy_with_optional_row_padding()` for HIP FP8 fallback to fill padded tail rows.
- Key code excerpts:

```python
elif hidden_states.shape[1] == w1.shape[2]:
    # Some ROCm FP8 MoE checkpoints load unpadded expert weights even when
    # SGLANG_MOE_PADDING is enabled globally.
    padded_size = 0
```

```python
def _copy_with_optional_row_padding(dst: torch.Tensor, src: torch.Tensor, pad_value: float = 0.0):
    if dst.shape == src.shape:
        dst.copy_(src)
        return
    dst[: src.shape[0]].copy_(src)
    if dst.shape[0] > src.shape[0]:
        dst[src.shape[0] :].fill_(pad_value)
```

- Validation implications: VLM-specific open PR, but shared fused-MoE/FP8 code can affect text GLM MoE. Keep ROCm FP8 padding tests separate from NVIDIA NVFP4 tests.

### PR #20917 - fix(serving_responses): check enable_thinking for qwen3/glm45 models

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/20917
- State: open as of `2026-04-23`
- Diff stats: `8` files, `+130/-19`
- Diff coverage: `/v1/responses` reasoning gating hunk and PR description diff reviewed; unrelated dependency/attention hunks noted as non-GLM motivation.
- Motivation: `/v1/responses` did not respect `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` for reasoning models such as Qwen3 and GLM45, while `/v1/chat/completions` already did. That caused disabled-thinking requests to be parsed as reasoning anyway.
- Key implementation: `_make_response_output_items()` computes `enable_reasoning` and disables reasoning parser when `self.reasoning_parser in ["qwen3", "glm45", "nemotron_3", "interns1"]` and `enable_thinking` is explicitly `False`.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
enable_reasoning = True
if self.reasoning_parser in ["qwen3", "glm45", "nemotron_3", "interns1"]:
    enable_reasoning = (
        not request.chat_template_kwargs
        or request.chat_template_kwargs.get("enable_thinking") is not False
    )

if self.reasoning_parser and enable_reasoning:
    reasoning_parser = ReasoningParser(...)
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/entrypoints/openai/serving_responses.py`, PR description, surrounding endpoint logic.
- Validation implications: `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` should match for GLM45 with `enable_thinking` unset, true, and false.

### PR #23067 - Fix: forward continue_final_message kwargs in Glm45Detector

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/23067
- State: open as of `2026-04-23`
- Diff stats: `2` files, `+66/-1`
- Diff coverage: full diff reviewed.
- Motivation: `ReasoningParser.__init__` forwards `continue_final_message` and `previous_content` when a chat completion request asks to continue a trailing assistant message. `Glm45Detector.__init__` did not accept those kwargs, so GLM-4.5 / GLM-5 requests failed with HTTP 500.
- Key implementation: extend `Glm45Detector.__init__` signature and forward the kwargs to `BaseReasoningFormatDetector`. Tests cover direct detector construction and request-driven `ReasoningParser("glm45", request=...)`.
- Key code excerpt:

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    stream_reasoning: bool = True,
    force_reasoning: bool = False,
    continue_final_message: bool = False,
    previous_content: str = "",
):
    super().__init__(
        "<think>",
        "</think>",
        tool_start_token="<tool_call>",
        continue_final_message=continue_final_message,
        previous_content=previous_content,
    )
```

- Reviewed files: `python/sglang/srt/parser/reasoning_parser.py`, `test/registered/unit/parser/test_reasoning_parser.py`
- Validation implications: keep this on GLM45/GLM5 radar. Any detector subclass should accept the same kwargs as the base parser path if it can be selected by `ReasoningParser`.

## Cookbook and Public Evidence

- sgl-cookbook [#92](https://github.com/sgl-project/sgl-cookbook/pull/92): GLM-4.5 AMD MI300X/MI325X/MI355X deployment evidence.
- sgl-cookbook [#95](https://github.com/sgl-project/sgl-cookbook/pull/95): GLM-4.5V AMD deployment evidence; use only as VLM-adjacent context unless shared text MoE code changes.
- Official SGLang docs document GLM-4.5/4.6/4.7 launch, parser split (`glm45` vs `glm47`), EAGLE/MTP flags, and thinking budget via `--enable-custom-logit-processor`.
- LMSYS GLM-4.5 public launch material documents day-one SGLang support, 128k context, native function calling, and MTP; treat it as deployment background, not a substitute for PR diff review.

## Validation Notes

- GLM-4.5 is the reference point for GLM MoE A2A, reduce-scatter defaults, shared-expert fusion, GLM reasoning parser, and XML tool parser.
- GLM-4.5V issues belong in the VLM/OCR lane unless the diff touches shared text MoE, fused-MoE, quantization, or parser code.
- Open PRs in this file were diff-reviewed but are not stable facts until merged; keep them as risk/radar cards.

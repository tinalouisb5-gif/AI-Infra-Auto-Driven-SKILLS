# sglang MOSS-VL PR Diff Audit Reference

- Rebuilt on: 2026-04-25
- Source baseline: `sgl-project/sglang` trace worktree commit `880599cd43`
- Collection: model implementation files were traced with `git log --name-only -- <model-files>`, filtered by model keywords in commit subjects, then every PR card was populated from the GitHub Pull Request files API.
- Extra preserved PRs from prior docs: 0
- Rule: use this evidence file before changing model-specific skill guidance; it is not only PR titles.

### PR #23454 - [srt] Add Moss-VL Python runtime support

- Link: https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/23454
- Status/date: merged / 2026-04-24
- Trace source: `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` found it through `python/sglang/srt/models/moss_vl.py`, `python/sglang/srt/multimodal/processors/moss_vl.py`; associated commits `59724e90a9b8`; preserved from an explicit existing history/skill citation
- Diff scope read: GitHub Pull Request files API returned 10 files, +2401/-6, 2611 readable patch lines; this card prioritizes model-related and high-change files.
- Motivation: Title: "[srt] Add Moss-VL Python runtime support"; model line: MOSS-VL; category: model support/runtime entry; main diff: `python/sglang/srt/models/moss_vl.py`, `python/sglang/srt/multimodal/processors/moss_vl.py`; PR body summary: This PR adds Python-side runtime support for Moss-VL in SRT. The changes include: - add `MossVLForConditionalGeneration` model support - add a Moss-VL multimodal processor - reg....

- Reviewed files:
  - runtime: `python/sglang/srt/models/moss_vl.py` added +1643/-0; `python/sglang/srt/multimodal/processors/moss_vl.py` added +612/-0
- Risk and verification: Runtime changes concentrate in `python/sglang/srt/configs/model_config.py`, `python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/flashinfer_backend.py`, `python/sglang/srt/managers/schedule_batch.py`; regression risk is weight loading, parallel sharding, attention/MoE backend selection, and parser output.

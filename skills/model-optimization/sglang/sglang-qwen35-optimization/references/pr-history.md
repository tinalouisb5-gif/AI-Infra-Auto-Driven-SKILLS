# sglang Qwen3.5 PR Diff Audit Reference

- Rebuilt on: 2026-04-25
- Source baseline: `sgl-project/sglang` trace worktree commit `880599cd43`
- Collection: model implementation files were traced with `git log --name-only -- <model-files>`, filtered by model keywords in commit subjects, then every PR card was populated from the GitHub Pull Request files API.
- Extra preserved PRs from prior docs: 17
- Rule: use this evidence file before changing model-specific skill guidance; it is not only PR titles.

# Result Schema

Write one JSON object per candidate. Keep failed candidates in the same file so
the final summary explains what was tried.

## Status Values

- `ok`: benchmark finished and metrics are trustworthy
- `failed`: command failed for a known non-OOM reason
- `oom`: model or candidate exhausted GPU/host memory
- `timeout`: server or benchmark timed out
- `skipped`: intentionally not run, with a reason in `failure_reason`

## Ranking Rule

The default ranking is:

1. `status == "ok"`
2. `sla.passed == true`
3. higher `metrics.request_throughput`
4. higher `metrics.output_token_throughput`
5. lower `metrics.p99_ttft_ms`
6. lower `metrics.p99_tpot_ms`
7. lower `hardware.gpu_count`

If the user cares more about token throughput than request throughput, swap
steps 3 and 4 and state that in the final report.

## Final Report Tables

The markdown summary must include these sections:

1. `Best Commands By Framework`: one table per framework. Each table has one row
   per workload scenario and includes the best candidate, SLA result, throughput,
   latency metrics, GPU count, exact server command, and artifacts.
2. `Cross-Framework Best Comparison`: one table that compares the best SGLang,
   vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM command for each scenario. Sort each scenario by the
   ranking rule above so the best deployment choice is first.
3. `Failed Or SLA-Failing Candidates`: include this table when any candidate
   failed, was skipped, or completed without passing SLA. This table records
   tried configs that were not selected. Keep each reason concrete enough to
   tell whether the candidate needs a retry, lower concurrency, a parameter fix,
   or no further action.

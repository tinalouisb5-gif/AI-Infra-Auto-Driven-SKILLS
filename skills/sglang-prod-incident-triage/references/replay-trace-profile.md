# Replay, Trace, Profile, and Bisect

Use this reference after the first round of debugging when you need something
reproducible, not just live snapshots.

It is especially useful for problems that only become repeatable after enough
real traffic has accumulated, or that depend on workload mix rather than one
obvious prompt.

## Request Dump and Replay

### Request dump

Enable request dump on a live server:

```bash
python3 -m sglang.srt.managers.configure_logging \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:30000 \
  --dump-requests-folder /tmp/sglang_request_dump \
  --dump-requests-threshold 100
```

This is useful when:

- the problem is intermittent
- you need the exact production request shape
- you do not want to restart the server

### Crash dump

If the server already runs with:

```bash
--crash-dump-folder /tmp/crash_dump
```

then SGLang records recent requests before a crash. This is the highest-value
dump for crash reproduction.

The crash-dump tests show the dump contains at least:

- `server_args`
- `requests`
- `launch_command` on current SGLang builds

Treat the dump as the best starting point for reproduction.
Summarize it first with:

```bash
python3 scripts/incident_artifact_tool.py summarize-dump \
  --input-file /path/to/crash_dump.pkl
```

### Replay

Use the checked-in replay tool:

```bash
python3 scripts/playground/replay_request_dump.py \
  --input-file /path/to/crash_dump.pkl \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 30000 \
  --parallel 128
```

Or replay a folder:

```bash
python3 scripts/playground/replay_request_dump.py \
  --input-folder /path/to/request_dump_dir \
  --file-number 10 \
  --parallel 128
```

On newer SGLang builds, `safe_pickle_load` may block some captured dump files
because they include classes such as `ServerArgs` or `GenerateReqInput`.
If the dump is locally captured and trusted, use the skill-local helper
`scripts/replay_trusted_request_dump.py` to bypass the allowlist and replay the
same requests over HTTP.
Treat this as a trust-boundary problem in the replay helper, not as a sign that
the dump is malformed.

Use replay before profiling when:

- the problem depends on a real workload mix
- the issue appears only after some number of requests
- you need to compare two builds against the same captured traffic

### CUDA coredump restart-and-replay

If replay suggests a CUDA crash path such as illegal memory access, warp
illegal instruction, or device-side assert, restart the same build with:

```bash
SGLANG_CUDA_COREDUMP=1 \
SGLANG_CUDA_COREDUMP_DIR=/tmp/sglang_cuda_coredumps \
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path ... \
  --crash-dump-folder /tmp/sglang_crash_dump \
  ...
```

SGLang auto-injects the required `CUDA_*` variables when
`SGLANG_CUDA_COREDUMP=1`, unless the shell already provided stricter values.
After reproducing the crash via replay, inspect the generated file with:

```bash
cuda-gdb "$(which python3)" \
  -ex "target cudacore /tmp/sglang_cuda_coredumps/cuda_coredump_<host>.<pid>.<ts>"
```

Useful first commands inside `cuda-gdb`:

- `where`
- `info cuda kernels`
- `x/10i <pc>`

Treat the coredump as the place to identify the *failing* kernel, not
necessarily the *source* of the bad data. It is common for the true bug to live
one kernel earlier in the routing or preprocessing chain.

For a concrete example of this exact pattern, see
[moe-shared-oob-case-study.md](moe-shared-oob-case-study.md). That example
corrupts one MoE top-k index in `topkGatingSoftmax`, but the coredump points to
the later `moe_align_block_size_kernel` shared-memory update.

## OpenTelemetry Tracing

### Bring-up

Tracing must be enabled at startup:

```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --enable-trace \
  --otlp-traces-endpoint localhost:4317 \
  ...
```

Optionally for the router:

```bash
python -m sglang_router.launch_router \
  --enable-trace \
  --otlp-traces-endpoint localhost:4317 \
  ...
```

Useful environment variables:

```bash
export SGLANG_OTLP_EXPORTER_SCHEDULE_DELAY_MILLIS=500
export SGLANG_OTLP_EXPORTER_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE=64
```

### Dynamic level control

If trace was enabled, adjust verbosity without restart:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:30000/set_trace_level?level=1"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:30000/set_trace_level?level=2"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:30000/set_trace_level?level=3"
```

### What tracing is good at

Tracing is best for:

- router vs worker delay attribution
- tokenizer / scheduler / detokenizer stage timing
- PD prefill/decode transfer timing
- request lifecycle clues across processes

Tracing is not a substitute for kernel-level profiling.

### Perfetto conversion

When you already have OTEL JSON or JSONL output:

```bash
python3 scripts/convert_otel_2_perfetto.py \
  --input /tmp/otel_trace.json \
  --output /tmp/sglang_trace_perfetto.json
```

Use this when you want a timeline view that is easier to inspect than raw OTEL.

## Torch Profiler Next Step

When replay, metrics, and trace data all point to a compute-side issue, switch
to `sglang-torch-profiler-analysis`.

Use that dedicated skill for:

- trace capture from a live server
- profile-v2 / `profile_by_stage` details
- rank-local versus merged trace choice
- kernel-table, overlap-table, and fuse-pattern analysis

This skill should only decide *when* profiling is justified, not
duplicate the full profiler workflow.

## Known-good vs known-bad commit regression

If one commit is known-good and a newer commit is known-bad:

1. build a deterministic harness from the problem
2. prefer replay-based harnesses when the failure depends on request mix
3. use `git bisect run <harness>`
4. only after bisect isolates a bad change, return to trace or profile if needed

Example:

```bash
git bisect start <bad> <good>
git bisect run bash ./repro_or_check.sh
```

## Debug Path Mapping

### Crash

Best order:

1. crash dump
2. summarize dump
3. replay
4. CUDA coredump plus `cuda-gdb`
5. CUDA crash skill or deeper instrumentation

### TTFT regression

Best order:

1. baseline metrics and loads
2. request dump
3. replay the same slow request
4. trace if stage ownership is still unclear
5. `sglang-torch-profiler-analysis` only if replay still points to compute-side ownership

For a concrete example of this lighter-weight escalation path, see
[ttft-prefill-not-queue-case-study.md](ttft-prefill-not-queue-case-study.md).
That example shows a TTFT spike where the bundle summary rules out queue
pressure first, then replay preserves the same slow request before deeper
analysis.

### Distributed hang

Best order:

1. healthy baseline bundle
2. capture the trigger request
3. replay the same request on a clean target
4. replay-time bundle during the hang
5. watchdog or py-spy stacks
6. NCCL collective identification
7. `debug-distributed-hang`

For a concrete example of this path, see
[communication-hang-case-study.md](communication-hang-case-study.md).
That example shows a request-shaped TP hang where the trigger request is first
saved and replayed, then the replay-time bundle and watchdog logs prove the
distributed stall before the deeper rank-by-rank workflow takes over.

### PD transfer stall

Best order:

1. loads with `disagg`
2. trace spans across prefill/decode
3. stage-separated profile if compute is still implicated

### Throughput regression after deploy

Best order:

1. compare `server_info`
2. compare `/metrics` and `/v1/loads`
3. replay stable workload
4. bisect if one older commit is known-good
5. `sglang-torch-profiler-analysis` if compute remains suspicious

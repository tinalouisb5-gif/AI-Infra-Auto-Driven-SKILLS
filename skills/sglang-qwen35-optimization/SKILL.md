# SGLang Qwen3.5 Optimization

## Overview

Qwen3.5 is a separate optimization lane because SGLang carries dedicated model files, MTP files, quantized checkpoint support, PP fixes, GDN projection fusion, and platform-specific tests.

Current evidence snapshot:

- SGLang `origin/main`: `b3e6cf60a` on `2026-04-22`
- sgl-cookbook `origin/main`: `816bad5` on `2026-04-21`
- Three-pass completeness audit: `model-pr-optimization-history/qwen-glm-three-pass-audit-2026-04-23.md`
- Runtime files: `python/sglang/srt/models/qwen3_5.py`, `python/sglang/srt/models/qwen3_5_mtp.py`
- Config: `python/sglang/srt/configs/qwen3_5.py`
- Cookbook/docs: `docs/basic_usage/qwen3_5.md`, `docs_new/cookbook/autoregressive/Qwen/Qwen3.5.mdx`

## Before You Change Anything

Capture:

- checkpoint: dense, MoE, FP8, NVFP4, MXFP4, or compressed-tensors variant
- whether MTP is enabled
- TP/EP/PP/DP shape and whether EPLB is active
- KV cache dtype and any FP8 KV caution note
- all-reduce backend, FlashInfer all-reduce fusion, and MoE backend
- hardware lane: H200, B200/GB200/GB300, AMD MI300/MI325/MI355, NPU, CPU/XPU

## Core Principle

Qwen3.5 is a high-risk loader and topology model.

- Most regressions come from weight-loader mapping, PP layer splitting, tied embeddings, quantization guards, or MTP cache behavior.
- Performance work is concentrated around GDN projection fusion, shared-expert fusion, MoE configs, all-reduce, and backend-specific quant kernels.
- Cookbook recipes are active and should be kept in sync with SGLang docs when server defaults change.

## Main Runtime Surfaces

## Optimization Order

1. Prove BF16 or reference checkpoint correctness.
2. Confirm weight-loader mapping, tied embeddings, and PP split rules.
3. Validate quantized loading under the exact target exporter.
4. Add MTP and EPLB compatibility tests.
5. Tune GDN projections and shared experts.
6. Update registered tests and cookbook configs for each hardware lane.
